ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @NatBat92, 30 years old and looking to build a portfolio while studying with the Code Institute.
 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in many things like going to the theatre, Dear Evan Hansen has been my favourite so far as it was the only one that has almost brought me to tears XD. Also enjoy playing with my two kittens Logan and Storm, Storm definately lives up to her name! I also enjoy going for a road trip with my girlfriend to lots of different locations, my favourite being a surprise birthday holiday to Wales where we were able to see a cave that was used in filming Batman (I am a huge Batman fan btw)

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Full Stack Development with the Code Institute and loving every second
